\chapter{Methods}
\label{cha:methods}

This chapter describes the application of theory shown in Chapter~\ref{cha:theory} applied to the pre-processed data described in Chapter~\ref{cha:data}. For further details regarding coding and implementation, the reader is referred to this work's \href{https://github.com/cosmourao/thesis}{\textcolor{blue}{repository}}.

In general, the use of Scikit-Learn's \texttt{pipeline} class alongside linear models made analysis straightforward. Additionally, Scikit-Learn's \texttt{GridSearchCV} allowed for a faster evaluation of different hyperparameters such as number of components and shrinkage factor.
