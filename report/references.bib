abstract = {An overview is given of the impact of nitrogen oxides on the environment and human health including the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia (NH3-SCR) over manganese-based materials. The review gives a comprehensive overview of NH3-SCR chemistry including the impacts of NOx, stringent regulations, limitations on NOx emissions and aspects of the reaction mechanism over Mn-based catalysts using isotopic labeled and in situ FT-IR studies. The review attempts to correlate catalyst activity and stability with the acidity, manganese oxidation state, surface texture, and structural morphology. Prospectively, low-temperature SCR of NOx over Mn-based catalysts opens up novel views to mitigate NOx and help us design the next generation industrial catalysts.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the present status and the perspective of de-NOx SCR catalysis for stationary sources, that is based on the reduction of NOx by NH3 to form water and nitrogen. After a brief description of the SCR chemistry the characteristics of commercial SCR catalysts, their physico-chemical properties and reactivity, and their performances in both NOx reduction and SO2 oxidation are presented. The mechanism of the SCR reactions, the mathematical modeling of the reactor and the arrangements of the reactor and process are then described. Finally the emerging technologies for NOx removal and the future perspectives of the SCR catalysis are outlined.}

	abstract = {Ammonia Ammonia (NH) 3 CAS 7664-41-7; UN 2672 (between 12% and 44% solution), UN 2073 (>44% solution), UN 1005 (anhydrous gas or >50% solution) Synonyms include ammonia gas, anhydrous ammonia, and liquid ammonia. Aqueous solutions are referred to as aqueous ammonia, ammonia solution, and ammonium hydroxide. C C Persons exposed only to ammonia gas do not pose significant risks of secondary contamination to personnel outside the Hot Zone. Persons whose clothing or skin is contaminated with liquid ammonium hydroxide can secondarily contaminate response personnel by direct contact or through off-gassing ammonia vapor. C C Ammonia dissolves readily in water to form ammonium hydroxide a corrosive, alkaline solution at high concentrations. C C Ammonia's pungent odor and irritating properties usually provide adequate warning of its presence; however, olfactory fatigue can occur. Inhalation can result in fatalities. Description At room temperature, anhydrous ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. It is lighter than air and flammable, with difficulty, at high concentrations and temperatures. It is easily compressed and forms a clear, colorless liquid under pressure. Anhydrous ammonia is hygroscopic. Ammonia dissolves readily in water to form ammonium hydroxide-an alkaline solution. The concentration of aqueous ammonia solutions for household use is typically 5% to 10% (weight:volume), but solutions for commercial use may be 25% (weight:volume) or more and are corrosive. Aqueous ammonia is commonly stored in steel drums. Anhydrous ammonia is stored and shipped in pressurized containers, fitted with pressure-relief safety devices, and bears the label "Nonflammable Compressed Gas". Despite not meeting the Department of Transport definition of flammable it should be treated as such.},
